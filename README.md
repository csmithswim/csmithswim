Hello World! 
I am learning Java and SQL.

I previously took coursework that involved HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, MongoDB and React. 

I am curious and interested in software development, computer science, data privacy, big data, climate change, renewable energy, sustainable design and climate migration.

In my free time I enjoy gardening, cooking and biking.
