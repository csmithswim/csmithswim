Hello World! 
I am learning Java, MySQL, Springboot, PostgreSQL, Kubernetes, Docker and Openshift.

I previously took coursework that involved HTML, CSS, SQL, SQLite, Javascript, Node, MongoDB and React. 

I am curious and interested in software development, computer science, blockchain, data privacy, big data, climate change, renewable energy, sustainable design and climate migration.

In my free time I enjoy gardening, cooking and biking.
