Hello! 

My name is Cullen and I am presently learning software/web development!

I am developing command-line interface games with Java to hammer down object oriented programming principles. \n
I am creating a full stack book-library web application that uses MongoDB/Node/HTML/CSS.

I also start my mornings off with an algorithm and a cup of joe!
