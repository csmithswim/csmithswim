Hello! 

My name is Cullen and I am an aspiring computer scientist focused on software/web development/engineering.

I am learning Python & Java and using them for full stack web applications.

I previously have learned Javascript/HTML/CSS/Node/MongoDB/React for different projects and problem solving algorithms.

I took a break from my education due to Covid-19 and other stuff I had to attend to.

Cheers!
