Hello! 

My name is Cullen and I am an aspiring computer scientist with a focus on software/web development/engineering.
I am presently learning and using Python & Java and their application in full stack development.
I previously have learned Javascript/HTML/CSS/Node/MongoDB for different projects and problem solving algorithms.

I took a break from my education due to Covid-19 and other stuff I had to attend to.

Cheers!
